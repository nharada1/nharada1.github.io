					<h3><a href="http://seed-hydroponics.herokuapp.com/">Seed Smart Hydroponics (2014)</a></h3>
					<p>
						For my senior capstone project, my team and I developed a smart hydroponic system that used user feedback and stochastic gradient descent to optimize plant growth. We developed a Django based server that offers both backend system control and a front end user dashboard. The hardware was based on an Arduino Mega and solid state relays for power control.
					</p>
					<p>				
						<em>Primary Technology Used:</em> Django, D3.js, Microcontrollers, Hardware

					<p>
						As an intern for iZotope, I helped the creative team improve fundamental frequency detection
						in Nectar 2, a vocal plugin suite for music professionals. I researched pitch detection algorithms 
						and compared performance across an expansive database of sounds, and eventually succeeded to produce a hybrid
						algorithm that outperformed the current method by about 10%.

					<h3><a href="http://www.impact-remix.com">iMpact (2012-2013)</a></h3>
					<p>
						What began as a class project turned into a full fledged application when some friends and I created
						iMpact, a unique drum app for the iPad. The application code was developed jointly by myself and two
						of my classmates. While originally a class project, we were encouraged by Steinway Music to consider
						expanding it into a commercial product. The app should be available in the App Store in the next few months.

					<p>				
						<em>Primary Technology Used:</em> Objective-C, ANSI C, JSON

					<h3><a href="http://www.impact-remix.com">DSP for iMpact (2013)</a></h3>
					<p>
						While I was involved in the creation of the iMpact app, after the class completed I put most 
						of my efforts to developing the DSP for the program. The app is designed to dynamically create new sounds on the fly, and as
						such we required a few different filters and effects. I ended up creating adjustable filters, digital delay, and ring modulation
						for use in the app. The end result of the work was in Objective-C, but most of the development process was done in MATLAB and 
						ANSI C.	I created the filters from analog IIR designs using the bilinear z-transform.

					<h3>Active Noise Cancellation System (2013)</h3>
					<p>
						I was approached by DDC to help them create an active noise cancellation system for a customer in the Chicagoland
						area. My team worked to develop an ANC system for a Roots style blower, an industrial blower used by warehouses and
						factories. My primary job was doing research to determine the most feasible possibilities. While the project is still
						in development (and therefore still under an NDA), our tenative plan is to use a single channel, FXLMS ANC system based off
						an active muffler.

						<em>Primary Technology Used:</em> Primarily research, also used recording equipment and iZotope's RX2 software

					<p>
						Advanced Network Devices wanted an in-house tool to control scheduling and other administrative functions
						on their line of IP Speaker devices. I contributed to the primary development of the program, along with 
						one other programmer. After a year of development the software was released to the public and is now an
						integral part of the IP Speaker line, currently in use by large customers controlling thousands of networked devices.

					<h3>AM Radio Transmitter</h3>
					<p>
						One of my class projects I'm most proud of, for our Electronics II final we had to build a working AM transmitter
						from only BJTs, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. No other components were allowed, and it was up to us to build
						a stable oscillator with no crystal. My group successfully built our transmitter and managed to transmit music across 
						a distance of 10 feet.

					<h3>IP Speaker Console (2008-2009)</h3>
					<p> 
						When I started work for Digital Design Corporation, my first task as an intern was to create test software for
						their new IP Speaker devices. I took over the development of the tool and took it from a simple command line program
						to a full-fledged GUI based testing suite. The tool is now used in house and on site to test and troubleshoot 
						devices.

					<h3>Even More!</h3>
					<p> 
						I've put only a few choice projects up here, but this list is by no means exhaustive. Want to hear about my homemade MIDI controller?
						Maybe some of my firmware work? How about the video game I made when I was in elementary school titled Superfish?
					</p>
					<p>
						I'd love to chat more 
						about them anytime, feel free to send me an email or give me a call. You can find my email on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, or
						my phone number in my resume.
