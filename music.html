				<h2>Concert Production</h2>
				<p>
					With a passion in music and an interest in leadership positions it was only a matter of time before I joined
					Tufts Concert Board. I started as a member and quickly rose to production assistant and then finally became
					one of two co-chairs in the organization. I've helped in and led production of some of Tufts' largest shows.

				<h2>Music Recording and Production</h2>
				<p>
					I've always had an interest in music, and once I got to school Tufts had the perfect program for me in the 
					music engineering minor. Besides the courses in the minor, I also produce my own music and work as a recording 
					engineer for WMFO Medford, the Tufts campus radio station.
				</p>
				<ul id="projects">
					<li>
						<h3>You Got Me Bad - American Symphony of Seoul</h3>
							<p id="audioplayer_1"><a href="media/you-got-me-bad.mp3">Listen Here</a></p>  
							<script type="text/javascript">  
							AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_1", {
								soundFile: "media/you-got-me-bad.mp3",
								titles: "You Got Me Bad",  
								artists: "American Symphony of Soul", 
							});  
							</script>  
						<p>
							Recorded as a final project for 'Music Recording and Production', this song is easily the most complex 
							complete song I've released, featuring a full brass combo band and a vocalist.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>On The Sunny Side Of The Street - American Symphony of Seoul</h3>
							<p id="audioplayer_2"><a href="media/on-the-sunny.mp3">Listen Here</a></p>  
							<script type="text/javascript">  
							AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_2", {
								soundFile: "media/on-the-sunny.mp3",
								titles: "On The Sunny Side of the Street",  
								artists: "American Symphony of Soul", 
							});  
							</script>  
						<p>
							Also recorded for 'Music Recording and Production', this is a stripped down version of the band and
							showcases a simpler arrangement while retaining high production values.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3>Ramona Was A Waitress - Paul Dempsey</h3>
							<p id="audioplayer_3"><a href="media/Ramona-Was-A-Waitress.mp3">Listen Here</a></p>  
							<script type="text/javascript">  
							AudioPlayer.embed("audioplayer_3", {
								soundFile: "media/Ramona-Was-A-Waitress.mp3",
								titles: "Ramona Was a Waitress",  
								artists: "Paul Dempsey", 
							});  
							</script>  
							<p>
								When Paul Dempsey (lead singer of Something For Kate) came to Boston he stopped by WMFO to record an on-the-air 
								session and interview. I was fortunate enough to engineer his session, and this is a mix of one of his more popular songs.
